# Classes

## Client(key, secret, *hostname="api.tempo-db.com"*, *port=443*, *secure=True*)
Stores the session information for authenticating and accessing TempoDB. Your api key and secret is required. The Client
also allows you to specify the hostname, port, and protocol (http or https). This is used if you are on a private cluster.
The default hostname and port should work for the standard cluster.

All access to data is made through a client instance.
### Members
* key - api key (string)
* secret - api secret (string)
* hostname - hostname for the cluster (string)
* port - port for the cluster (int)
* secure - protocol to use (True=https, False=http)

## DataPoint(ts, value)
Represents one timestamp/value pair.
### Members
* ts - timestamp (datetime)
* value - the datapoint's value (double, long, boolean)

## Series(id, key, *name=""*, *attributes={}*, *tags=[]*)
Respresents metadata associated with the series. Each series has a globally unique id that is generated by the system
and a user defined key. The key must be unique among all of your series. Each series may have a set of tags and attributes
that can be used to filter series during bulk reads. Attributes are key/value pairs. Both the key and attribute must be
strings. Tags are keys with no values. Tags must also be strings.
### Members
* id - unique series id (string)
* key - user defined key (string)
* name - human readable name for the series (string)
* attributes - key/value pairs providing metadata for the series (dictionary - keys and values are strings)
* tags - (list of strings)

## DataSet(series, start, end, *data=[]*, *summary=None*)
Respresents data from a time range of a series. This is essentially a list of DataPoints with some added metadata. This is the object
returned from a query. The DataSet contains series metadata, the start/end times for the queried range, a list of the DataPoints
and a statistics summary table. The Summary table contains statistics for the time range (sum, mean, min, max, count, etc.)
### Members
* series - series metadata (Series)
* start - start time for the queried range (datetime)
* end - end time for the queried range (datetime)
* data - datapoints (list of DataPoints)
* summary - a summary table of statistics for the queried range (Summary)

# Client API

## create_series(*key=None*)

Creates and returns a series object, optionally with the given key.

### Parameters
* key - key for the series (string)

### Returns
The newly created Series object

### Example

The following example creates two series, one with a given key of "my-custom-key", one with a randomly generated key.

    from tempodb import Client

    client = Client("api-key", "api-secret")

    series1 = client.create_series('my-custom-key')
    series2 = client.create_series()

## get_series(*ids=[]*, *keys=[]*, *tags=[]*, *attributes={}*)
Gets a list of series objects, optionally filtered by the provided parameters. Series can be filtered by id, key, tag and
attribute.
### Parameters
* ids - a list of ids to include (list of strings)
* keys - a list of keys to include (list of strings)
* tags - a list of tags to filter on. These tags are and'd together (list of strings)
* attributes - a dictionary of key/value pairs to filter on. These attributes are and'd together. (dictionary)

### Returns
A list of Series objects

### Example

The following example returns all series with tags "tag1" and "tag2" and attribute "attr1" equal to "value1".

    from tempodb import Client

    client = Client("api-key", "api-secret")

    tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]
    attributes = {
        "attr1": "value1"
    }

    series_list = client.get_series(tags=tags, attributes=attributes)

## read(start, end, *interval=""*, *function=""*, *ids=[]*, *keys=[]*, *tags=[]*, *attributes={}*)

Gets a list of DataSets for the specified start/end times. The interval parameter allows you to specify a rollup period. For example,
"1hour" will roll the data up on the hour using the provided function. The function parameter specifies the folding function
to use while rolling the data up. A rollup is selected automatically if no interval or function is given. The auto rollup interval
is calculated by the total time range (end - start) as follows:

* range <= 2 days - raw data is returned
* range <= 30 days - data is rolled up on the hour
* else - data is rolled up by the day

Rollup intervals are specified by a number and a time period. For example, 1day or 5min. Supported time periods:

* min
* hour
* day
* month
* year

Supported rollup functions:

* sum
* max
* min
* avg or mean

You can also retrieve raw data by specifying "raw" as the interval. The series to query can be filtered using the
remaining parameters.

### Parameters
* start - start time for the query (datetime)
* end - end time for the query (datetime)
* interval - the rollup interval (string)
* function - the rollup folding function (string)
* ids - a list of ids to include (list of strings)
* keys - a list of keys to include (list of strings)
* tags - a list of tags to filter on. These tags are and'd together (list of strings)
* attributes - a dictionary of key/value pairs to filter on. These attributes are and'd together. (dictionary)

### Returns
A list of DataSets

### Example

The following example returns a list of series from 2012-01-01 to 2012-01-02 for the series with key "my-custom-key",
with the maximum value for each hour.

    import datetime
    from tempodb import Client

    client = Client("api-key", "api-secret")

    start = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1)
    end = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 2)
    keys = ["my-custom-key",]

    data = client.read(start, end, keys=keys, interval="1hour", function="max")


## read_id(series_id, start, end, *interval=""*, *function=""*)

Gets a DataSet by series id. The id, start, and end times are required. The same rollup rules apply as for the multi series
read (above).

### Parameters
* series_id - id for the series to read from (string)
* start - start time for the query (datetime)
* end - end time for the query (datetime)
* interval - the rollup interval (string)
* function - the rollup folding function (string)

### Returns

A DataSet

returns a minimum datapoint per day.

    import datetime
    from tempodb import Client

    client = Client("api-key", "api-secret")

    start = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1)
    end = datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 1)

    data = client.read_id("38268c3b231f1266a392931e15e99231", start, end, interval="1day", function="min")


## read_key(series_key, start, end, *interval=""*, *function=""*)

* start - start time for the query (datetime)
* end - end time for the query (datetime)
* interval - the rollup interval (string)
